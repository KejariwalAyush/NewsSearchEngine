# NewsSearchEngine

A Project for Algorithm design. Making a News Search Engine like thing in Java.

## Introduction

This project is loosely based on the concept of BST. BST (Binary Search Tree)
is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

● The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

● The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

● The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

Binary Search Trees have an overall running time of O(log n). This makes it
one of the fastest search algorithms and we can search and sort through a lot
of data within milliseconds. This project also uses BST to search through
approximately 1000 links for the user specified query and gives us our
desired result in fractions of seconds.

## Goal

The goal of this project/program was to get only those news and news
snippets that interest the user and that is exactly what is being done. Once
the data from the different sites has been loaded the user is asked to enter
his query. If the user wants some particular sport related news he or she can
enter that sport name. The program then within milliseconds gives the user
all trending links related to that sport that are available in those news sites.
Thus this search engine becomes highly specific user vise.
